Python implementation of Radial Basis Function Networks.
This package aims to provide an efficent implementation of RBFN in python.

Currently you can import an RBFN from the Neural Network Toolbox(TM) and
run it in python. You can use the mlab.export_code to generate a matlab export
script and then use mlab.load to load to run the exported network.

Also you can train your own network using the following functions:

train_exact - "Train" an exact RBFN from a given Input-Output set.

Other functions will be added (non-exact training, ecc...)
Other backends will be added...

WORK IN PROGRESS :)
